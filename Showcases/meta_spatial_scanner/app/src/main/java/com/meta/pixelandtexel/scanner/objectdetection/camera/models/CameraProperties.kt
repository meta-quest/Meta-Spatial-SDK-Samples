 *
 * @property eye Specifies which [CameraEye] eye the camera properties correspond to (e.g. LEFT or
 *   RIGHT).
 * @property translation The [Vector3] position of the camera in 3D space.

 * @property focalLength The focal length of the camera lens, typically in pixels, for both x and y
 *   axes in a [Vector2].
 * @property principalPoint The optical center of the image, typically in pixels, in a [Vector2].
 * @property resolution The [Size] width and height of the camera's image sensor or output image, in
