# MRUK sample

The MRUK sample shows how to build an immersive experience influenced by the physical world around the user. It shows how to overlay virtual objects on top physical objects in the room (tables, couches, windows, doors, beds, and more).

## Highlighted feature

The MRUK Sample uses [Mixed Reality Utility Kit](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/spatial-sdk/spatial-sdk-mruk) to enable the user to interact with their physical surroundings. It shows best practices for requesting permission to access scene mode, retrieving scene data from the device, and interacting with the meshes that represent the physical world.

## Sample Experiences

### Anchor Mesh

This sample demonstrates how to anchor virtual objects to physical surfaces in your environment. Learn how to place and manipulate 3D models on detected surfaces like tables, floors, and walls.

### Keyboard Tracker

This sample shows how to track and interact with a physical keyboard in mixed reality. It demonstrates detecting keyboard position and enabling typing while maintaining visual awareness of your surroundings.

### QR Code Scanner

This sample illustrates how to implement QR code scanning functionality in a mixed reality application. Learn how to detect and process QR codes to trigger actions or load content.

### Raycast

This sample demonstrates using raycasting to interact with the physical environment. It shows how to detect surfaces and place objects with precision using ray-based interaction.
